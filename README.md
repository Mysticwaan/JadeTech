## Phase 1

This project is inspired by the rapidly evolving capabilities of AI and machine learning. The possibilities are endless, and it’s thrilling to explore ideas that were unimaginable for solo developers just a few years ago. With this in mind, I crafted a clear plan to bring this vision to life:

## Game Identity
I experimented with various colors and art styles to define the aesthetic for this cyber-futuristic card game.

The results already feel unique!

Next, I dedicated significant time to modeling and designing different card concepts.

These six designs emerged as top contenders, but there’s still work to be done.

Of course, no card game is complete without the creatures that bring it to life!

Time to invest in assets:

I purchased a set of adorable monster assets that, with a bit of refinement, hold great potential.

## Phase 2
Phase two introduces "V," your guide through the Jade-Tech interface.

I am V, an advanced AI and the strategic backbone of Jade Tech. Allow me to demonstrate the interface:

The interface, though detailed, is user-friendly:

![Tutorial](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0799acca-1bd5-441b-86a4-30a9e90358c7)

Primarily, you’ll manage your deck and visualize cards in 3D.

The active card slots are the primary tools during gameplay in Jade-Tech.

Jade-Tech features two worlds:

The upper world exudes vibrant, electric energy, while the underworld contrasts with a dark, shadowy atmosphere.
