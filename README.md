You can also stay on Git and find out about my design process below &#x2B07;

## Phase 1

This project was made using revitalised inspiration from all the new ai and machine learning technology coming out. the potential seems limitless and its exciting to even think about all the crazy things you can do now that you couldnt even 5 years ago as a solo developer! with that being said i had a clear game plan on what i need to make this project come to life:

## Game Identity
So i tried experimenting with different colours and art style for this cyber futuristic card game and...

It's already feeling special!

Next up i spend a embarrising amount of time modelling and designing different card designs

## Cards>>>

Ofcourse a card game is nothing without the creatures bringing them to life!

## Phase 2
For Phase two let me introduce you to V, he'll take it from here (he's a bit corny)

![guide](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/56a16049-2e9b-461b-ba22-eba4b31332c5)

I am V, a cutting-edge AI and the unrivaled tactician of Jade Techâ€” Let me give you a run down of the UI you will be using:

will display several different things and it might look a little confusing at first but its fairly simple:


![Tutorial](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0799acca-1bd5-441b-86a4-30a9e90358c7)

As you can see its mainly a card select menu that lets you move around your cards in your deck and display them in 3d

![Screenshot 2024-12-30 095712](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3703d77a-7b73-4cbf-838e-5bb063af56b6)

You also have active card slots which is what you will primarly be using as you are running around Jade-Tech

Here are some behind the scenes on some of the scripting currently going on:

Now back at Jade-Tech we have to worlds that you'll play in

![ewqq](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/15f1055b-3cb0-434d-9b4c-03e99807d87d)

The upper world will have a bright and electric tone while the underworld will have a dark and shadowy tone to contrast and seperate the two worlds.
